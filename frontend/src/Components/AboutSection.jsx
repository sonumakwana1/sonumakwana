I am Sonu Makwana, a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a strong academic foundation in science. I hold a Bachelor's degree from Madhav Science College, affiliated with Vikram University, and a Master's degree in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at Vikram University.

Although my academic journey began in science, my passion for technology led me to pursue a career in the IT industry. I have successfully transitioned into the tech field by learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), completing hands-on internships, and building multiple real-world projects.

With a strong analytical mindset and a growing expertise in full-stack development, I am eager to contribute to innovative and impactful tech solutions while continuously expanding my skill set in web development.
